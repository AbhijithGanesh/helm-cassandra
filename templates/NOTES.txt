If you haven't applied the Peristent Volume Claim before, please apply then upgrade the process.
You can edit the persistent volume claim variables.

Great to see you deploy the Cassandra-Chart. You have succesfully deployed t
the chart without any hazards. There are a couple of things you need to remember here

To access the metrics via TCP/HTTP, you need to portforward the pod which is running.
The pod can be accessed by finding kubectl get pods

Once done, you can port-forward by using the command (If you haven't used custom ports)

kubectl port-forward <pod-name> 9042 8080

You can choose to port-forward 8080 if you want to view the metrics.

If you have , you need to supply the custom values.
